# Flutter Modular Monorepo with Melos

This repository demonstrates a scalable and maintainable architecture for building modular Flutter apps using [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) and [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router). 

This is just the architecture not a code example, Just to demonstrate the concept.

## ðŸ§± Structure Overview

This repo is structured as a monorepo with multiple apps and reusable feature packages (modules).

flutter_melos_modular_template/
â”œâ”€â”€ melos.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app1/ # Flutter app with custom theme and modules
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app2/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ app3/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ core/ # Shared utils, services
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ shared_ui/ # Common UI widgets
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ auth_module/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ search_module/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ profile_module/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ project_x_module/



Each app can define which modules to include based on its own requirements.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Melos

```bash
dart pub global activate melos


# 2. Bootstrap the workspace

melos bootstrap
This links all packages and dependencies.

# 3. Run any app
cd apps/app1
flutter run

ðŸ’¡ Each app has its own main.dart and includes only the modules it needs.

ðŸ§­ Routing & Navigation
Each module exports:

routes: for GoRouter sub-routes

tabs: for bottom navigation items (icon + label)

Apps combine the routes from the modules they include.

To remove a module from an app:

Remove its import in main.dart

Remove its route and tab references

Rebuild â€” the module will no longer appear in the UI


âœ… Benefits of This Architecture
Modularity: Each feature lives in its own package

Custom App Builds: Each app can include different sets of features and themes

Scalability: Easy to add, remove or update modules

Maintainability: Isolated features with clear boundaries

Code Reuse: Shared UI and core logic packages



ðŸ“¦ Available Modules
auth_module: Login, signup, user session

search_module: Advanced search interface

profile_module: User profile

project_x_module: Optional experimental module

You can create your own module using the template or duplicate any existing one.
